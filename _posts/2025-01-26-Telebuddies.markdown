A month and a half into my internship I had a craving for games creation and signed up for GGJ-25.
I teamed up with a couple of class mates and we were joined at the jam by a professional dev.
Unfortunately for him (and/or us) we had decided to make the game in UE whereas he only had
experience with Unity but he turned out to be a great level designer and this way it was less
stressful for him I suppose.

Something that turned out to later cause half an hour of panic was that my class mates wanted to
use blueprints while I felt much more comfortable with C++. Naturally, I told them it was no
problem since everything is eventually turned into a BP-class anyway.

This year's theme was "Bubbles" and while brainstorming I mentioned that a bubble can refer to a
self-contained universe and what if we could base the game on a mechanic that lets the player
travel between realms? This idea was soon mutated into something much more akin to Portal, but
where you shoot bubbles to which you can teleport.

Since I was more experienced with Niagara, I ended up doing most of the FX, such as the air flow
effect from the fans.
