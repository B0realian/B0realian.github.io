This was my first real school project, after only three months of getting to know Unity and C#. Three programmers teamed up
with three artists for 7 weeks of furious development. Most of the time, at least for us programmers, was spent trying to
learn how to do the things the game required. One player controls the little astronaut, the other player moves the modules
around to create a path for the first player.

Initially, I was only supposed to do character movement, which in itself is often a large post and in this case made more
complicated by the fact that gravity can be turned off which changes movement dramatically. However, one of the other
programmers had an exam to study for, then got sick, then his kids got sick in succession and then he was mandated to
spend Christmas and New Year with his family and so it was mostly up to just two of us the create the game. So, I also
got inputs and module behaviour, made all animations out of the supplied spritesheets and the animator, code for lethal
traps and the oxygen system.
