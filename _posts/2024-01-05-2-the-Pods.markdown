This was my first real school project, after only three months of getting to know Unity and C#. Three programmers teamed up
with three artists for 7 weeks of furious development. One player controls the little astronaut, the other player moves the modules
around to create a path for the first player. The astronaut has an oxygen gauge that runs down, inciting the players to hurry.
There are also a number of deadly traps strewn across the modules for the astronaut to avoid. Upon death, the astronaut is
simply returned to the start of the level but the modules remain in place. Every new level, the roles are interchanged.

Initially, I was only supposed to do character movement, which in itself is often a large post and in this case made more
complicated by the fact that gravity can be turned off which changes movement dramatically. However, one of the other
programmers had an exam to study for, then got sick, then his kids got sick in succession and then he was mandated to
spend Christmas and New Year with his family and so it was mostly up to just two of us the create the game. So, I also
got inputs and module behaviour, made all animations out of the supplied spritesheets and the animator, code for lethal
traps and the oxygen system.
