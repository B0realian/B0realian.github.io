Not long after our first project was finished, we dove into our first solo-projects. Four weeks to create a mobile game
using Firebase as an online data storage. Since we could no longer rely on artists to create graphics, the games we
produced were significantly less appealing to the eye. But since I can be incredibly stupid (yes, you can quote me on
that) I spent nearly two whole weeks making graphics.
