Hard on the heels of the VR project came our last project before starting our internships. We had
8 weeks to showcase what we had learnt after a year of studies. How and what to do was left to
ourselves to decide. So I decided to keep learning new things in Unreal Engine!

My goals for this project was to create my own character movement, i.e. to not use the Character
Movement Component supplied by the engine, to utilize raw input controls, to write a decent AI,
and to get the hang of creating UI widgets in code. In the process, I also learnt how to
leverage dynamic materials, something I ended up spending more time on than several of my other
goals. I was also forced to spend quite a lot of time in finding an internship, a process that
I, in all honesty, found harrowing and depressing. If you ever need me to pour my bitterness on
you, you can ask me more about it some time.

So, a natural fit for my combined goals was a flight simulator! I've loved flight sims since
playing so many of them on my Amiga 500.
