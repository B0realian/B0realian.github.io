			<p style="width: 35%;">Most of you in GP23 know Nornware from the bonus lectures we received on shaders at the start of our second year. I know a lot of us felt like it was a bit too much to take in and understand at that point but I'm sure everyone else was equally awed with how much can be done visually by just fiddling with numbers in shaders. Naturally, my instinct was to think that this is what I should add to my toolkit! </p>
