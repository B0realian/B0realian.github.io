        <p>Hi, I am Philip, a programmer graduated from Yrgo's Game Creator Programmer program. I had very limited programming skills before enrolling but it was an intense experience and after only two years I had learnt enough C# in Unity and C++ in Unreal 5 to make games in 2D and 3D. Straying off the curriculum, I also learnt enough low level C/C++ to create a slimmed down engine or renderer with OpenGL. To demonstrate my dedication to learning this wonderful art, I could point out that I had to balance school with both work and family. Did I mention it was intense?
        </p>
        <p> The fruits of my labours are outlined in the portfolio section, the section you casually scrolled past to get to read about me. Technically I suppose everything on this site is all about me, so, in that sense you really can't go wrong!
        </p>
        <p>Coding games has been a long nurtured dream that I abandoned long ago (until more recently, obviously) and so I have mostly done lots of other stuff, such as working as a quality assurance consultant, a brief stint doing economics for a logistics company, graduating from the University of Hull with a BA in PPE, and working as a bicycle courier in Gothenburg. For more detailed information, download my CV.

        <p>Other than committing myself to the art of creating games, I am a father, boardgamer, philosopher, test driver, beekeeper and trained killer. If we were working together we would have the best of times!
        </p>
        <p>I didn't list gamer above because that kind of goes without saying. However, I suck at most games partly because I'm generally more interested in story or exploration and partly because I prefer playing as relaxation. Saying that, I have played computer games for a long time but some of my most treasured memories come from Sid Meier's Pirates, Wing Commander, Zelda (take your pick), GTA3 and Left4Dead. Having had less time to play the past ten years (yeah, something happened) I have become something of a Nintendo fan-boy, playing all those Zeldas and loving all (except for Tears of the Kingdom), the most excellent Pikmin games, Mario Kart (still think Double Dash nailed it), and am eagerly anticipating the release of the next Metroid Prime on the 4th of December but who keeps track of such things?
